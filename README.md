# Cheat Files

Manpages are comprehensive but take forever to read. Use the cheatsheets displayed by [cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat) for quick-reference instead! This is my collection of cheatsheets, 
sourced mainly from [Snifer/security-cheatsheets](https://github.com/Snifer/security-cheatsheets), 
which is included as a submodule for quick updating.
